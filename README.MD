## Description

This is my portfolio web site. 

It's where I'll post things about myself, my development work, past projects, education, and work experience. 

It's meant to be a one-stop place to snoop around on who I am, what I'm about, and what kind of work I've done and want to do in the future.

Happy snooping!
